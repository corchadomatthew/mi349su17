Final ProjectThere will be four sections of my ‘Geeks with Opinions’ website. They will each focus on an individual topic of discussion. They will be, the home-page or About me, Movies, T.V., and Video Games. Each section will also have a background that was designed to correspond to the content of that specific topic.About Me:This section will just introduce me and how, ‘Geeks with Opinions’ came to life and where I plan to take the website in the future. This will also go into detail about what each section of the website does from movies to video games. Movies:The movies section will allow users to see a list of the biggest upcoming movies of that week and a picture of that films poster next to it. T.V.:The T.V. section will give my short review of the biggest television series that are on at the moment.Also this will feature a picture/poster of that show and my score of the series.Video Games:The Video Games section will allow users to see my most anticipated video games of the upcoming year, and why I am anticipating their release. Similar to the other sections this will have an image or poster of the upcoming video game, if available.
