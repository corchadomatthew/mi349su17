    <h2>Chunking</h2>
    <img src="Chunking.png" alt="Chunk" style="width: 500px;">
    <p>Reddit is an excellent example of 'Chunking' for several reasons. One
      standout reason is just the way the information on the page is laid-out.
      All of the important information on the page is highlighted in blue.
      They are short and sweet headlines of the information that is presented when
      you click on the link.

    <h2>Signal-to-Noise</h2>
    <img src="signal_to_noise.png" alt="S2N" style="width: 500px;">
    <p>Google does a very job of using white space to portray 'Signal-to-noise ratio'.
      As you can see, on the home page of Google the standout information is the giant,
      'Google' in colored letters. The accent of white that surrounds the title, and
      the limited amount of noise is the reason this website does a great job of showing
      signal-to-noise ratio.

    <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
    <img src="Hick's_Law.png" alt="Hick's" style="width: 500px;">
    <p>'Hick's Law' focuses on simplicity and trying to help the user make a decision
      quicker and without thought. Apple's home page is a very simple and good example
      of 'Hick's Law' because of the layout of the menus at the top. The menus are very
      simple and content surrounding the menus are very simple. This simplicity will
      allow a user to look at something that catches their eyes and make a quick and
      easy decision.

    <h2>Mapping</h2>
    <img src="mapping.png" alt="Mapping" style="width: 500px;">
    <p>The Best Buy website search bar does a good job at portraying the segway between
      the users curiosity to the users desired product. This idea of 'Mapping' is used
      on many websites but Best Buy does a good job at making the search bar on their
      website accessible and accurate. They use a magnifying glass as the submit button
      which definitely is unique and catches the eye.

    <h2>Affordance</h2>
    <img src="Affordance.png" alt="Affordance" style="width: 500px;">
    <p>"START YOUR FREE TRIAL" is something we see on any subscription based website
      in big letter and designed in a way that portrays 'Affordance'. Hulu's home page
      as a design focused around those four words they believe are most important to
      the user. This design is a good example of the 3D button that the 'Affordance'
      design of a website requires.
